# Week 8 Day 0 Notes

I spent yesterday finalizing my work refactoring Cranelift's internal DSL from
Python into Rust, and finally opened a PR! It's been an adventure getting
here, but along the way I've learned a ton about Rust, and how compilers work.
This was also a little disorienting, because it was the other primary project
I'd planned to work on at RC. In the meantime however, I got some feedback
from one of the contributors and I'm spending my morning fixing up these
details.

On a separate note, I saw a neat issue regarding updates in LLVM and how the
generated sizes of wasm binaries had changed. It turned out, they were using
twiggy to diagnose that! :tada: Other victories included learning how to use a
specific version of Rust in a specific directory, and learning about the
`try_for_each` method.

In the evening I helped run the Papers Recursers Like event, and was really
happy to see so many interesting topics discussed.
