# Day 2

### Morning / Afternoon

Today I spent a fair amount of time in the morning pair programming. This was
nice, because I got to introduce one of my friends to the codebase that I
have been helping to maintain, and learned some nice design patterns and
workflow techniques in the process.

My friend Sönke has more background with Haskell than I, and one of the
interesting things about learning more Rust together has been that some of
the language features are already quite familiar to them. Another trait that
I have been picking up from this has been a stricter adherence to TDD
(test-driven development) philosophy, which I have found very useful to help
keep myself on track during a task.

We worked on an open issue for `twiggy`, to add regular expressions to a
sub-command used to print dominator trees for items/functions in a WebAssembly
binary. We also spent some time looking into how to debug Atom, the editor
that Sönke uses primarily. As an aside, Electron makes for a really neat
platform for an editor because editing internal functionality is quite
approachable.

After that, we spent some time studying how project structures in Rust work,
how object destructuring and pattern matching work, and some of the things that
Rust's enums allow and disallow. Once we were done with that, we spent some
time talking about events that might be fun to organize during our time at
RC, and talked about some of the differences between TypeScript and Flow.

### Afternoon

In the afternoon, I spent some more time working on `twiggy`, and finished
up the rest of the work that had been started in the morning while pair
programming in the morning. I spent some time communicating with some of the
other members of the Rust-WASM working group, and read some review notes that
had been left on a patch I worked on for `cretonne`.

This patch will be worked on further tomorrow, but in the mean time I knew
that I needed to finish up some slides that I wanted to present tomorrow for
the technical talks. I also made some new friends, and talked about some
of our experiences with and strategies for technical interviews.
