# Day 3

### Morning

I had an early start today, and got to the space fairly early. I spent some
time getting a better understanding of how to use Zulip, and reading. My
friend Ross was the second person to arrive today, so we had some time
to talk about how our weeks were progressing.

We talked about unit testing practices, Python libraries that we liked, and
a little bit about Fortran, and then discussed open source contribution. I
showed him CodeTriage, a website that allows you to find open source projects
that need help from new contributors, and I gave some advice on finding issues
that are good starting points by filtering for issues in GitHub that are tagged
as a good first issue, or offer mentorship.

I wrapped up some of the slides that I had been working on for the
presentations tonight, and RSVP'd to some events that are happening today.

After that, I prepared myself to return to the `cretonne` issue that I had
been working on. At this point, there are only a few details to iron out,
and from there I should be about done with that!

I will hopefully try and spend some time researching the ELF compatibility
issue for `twiggy`, and maybe open a tracking issue for this.
