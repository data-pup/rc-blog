# Day 4

RC technically is only open from Monday to Thursday, so Friday's are an extra
day that you can optionally come in if you would like. I spent my morning
planning with some of my friends that are in the mini batch that ended last
night, we are going to go a birthday party today!

I also spent some time writing some help on error handling in Rust for some
questions that were posted in the Rust study group channel. There are some
unique things about Rust and its opinions of handling errors, so this gave
me a fun chance to review things, and provide some links that helped me out
when I was starting out in Rust.

I also spent some time talking with some new friends I made last night, and
learned a new way to make coffee.

Before I head out to the birthday party, I am going to try and take some notes
to prepare for my `twiggy` project. This will require learning more about
object file formats, DWARF, and some other topics that I have been previously
unfamiliar with!
