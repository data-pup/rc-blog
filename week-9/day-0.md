Had a nice weekend, largely avoiding computers but managing to get some work
done too `:simple_smile:` Someone made a pretty neat PR to twiggy, which added a
feature to one of the sub-commands. I spent part of Friday and Saturday
morning making similar changes to the other sub-commands, and made a PR for
that.

I also solved an issue on the Cranelift repo, following up on my previous
work. It turns out, Cargo can take care of some of the things I was doing
manually, so I got to make some changes that simplified my code :)

Saturday was also spent at the picnic, which turned out to be great fun. It
was nice seeing everybody outside `:deciduous_tree:` This week I'm planning on
starting a very silly project, to keep things whimsical whilst I start
job-hunting. Today I'll also be reviewing some topics to present on tomorrow
for the Rust study group.
