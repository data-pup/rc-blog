# Week 7 Day 2 Notes

Spent the vast majority of yesterday working on Cretonne stuff. The victory of
the day was finishing up the work related to the metaprogramming code for
emitting the rest of the lane types. These are all of the different scalars
that could be represented as lanes in a SIMD instruction.

Some of the code I've written regarding this feels a little clunky, but I
think I have some ideas about how I restructure this. That'll be on the back
burner in the short-term however, I need to finish up the work related to the
emitting types that are used to represent SIMD vectors first.
