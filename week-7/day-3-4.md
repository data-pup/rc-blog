# Week 7 Day 3-4 Notes

Spent the past two days working on more Cretonne things. The project was
renamed 'cranelift' today, so that'll be how I refer to it in future
check-ins. Made a lot of good progress, and had a Rust wizard friend of mine
review my code. They said it all looked very reasonable, and all of the qualms
they did have were more related to the original code that I'm re-implementing,
rather than my own work.

I should be able to open up a PR for this on Monday or so. Got in touch in the
project maintainer about this, and they were excited about that. Less excited
for the inevitably nightmarish rebase that the project's renaming process will
likely entail. Other than that, I presented on Thursday.
