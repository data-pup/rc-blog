# Week 1 Day 3 Notes

I started my day working more on `twiggy`, and ended up making a lot of
progress! I got into touch with the project maintainer, and showed some
of the progress that I have made over the past few days, and aside from
some general style points, and some details regarding how to calculate the
size of an object, I do seem to be in the right direction.

This was extremely nice to find out, because this has definitely been one
of the hardest projects that I have tackled so far in my experience as a
programmer.

One of the other interesting discussions in the morning amongst some of the
Recursers in my batch regarded what it means to become a better programmer.
Does this only relate to technical prowess? Some of the really good points
that were made in these talks also included the fact that some of this
can include improving oneself in personal ways that might not relate to
technology specifically.

In the afternoon, one of the Recursers from the Spring batch hosted a talk
on Algebraic Datatypes (ADT's) in Haskell. This covered a lot of really
interesting academic CS topics, and continued to make me more interested
in learning more about the language.
