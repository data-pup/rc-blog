# Week 1 Day 2 Notes

Did not sleep especially well last night, but still tried to arrive to RC
at a decent time. Spent some of the morning chatting a little bit with
friends, and wrote a check-in concerning what I learned yesterday.

I will be leading a workshop on learning a new programming language today,
so that should be a lot of fun! Until then I plan on spending the early
parts of today working on some of the `twiggy` work that I was focusing on
yesterday.

I spent the rest of the morning and early part of the afternoon working on
the debugging information consumption logic. This is starting to make a lot
more sense, and I got a lot of logic in place!

I spent some time helping another Recurser with some issues that they were
having with the borrow checker, which was also a nice refresher for me in
understanding what the ownership system in Rust actually aims to accomplish.
I provided some documentation, and an example implemented in Javascript showing
what happens in other languages that do not provide the same safety. Yay!

I also met with one of the facilitators and talked a little about the resources
that they provide regarding finding employment after my batch, since I think
I would really like to try and stay in this area if possible.

I found some neat activities that I am planning on spending some time on
tomorrow night, enough that I have to actually make choices! Ahhh!

I have some cleanup work to get done on the code that I wrote to step through
compilation units and entries within those units, I think I could handle errors
a little bit more elegantly, and I think I have a better understanding of how
the `extra` types are used in the trait I am trying to implement.

There might be some other ways to structure this that I will think about later
on, but for now I will try and get at least one of the methods in the `Parse`
trait working before I think too much about refactoring.
