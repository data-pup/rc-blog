# Week 1 Day 4 Notes

Started my day off switching back into work on `cretonne`. I drafted some of
the logic for a small helper class that will be needed, and then got in touch
with the maintainer asking some overview questions to help me along with
the refactoring work.

This afternoon I will be pairing on some Rust work with my friend Sid. Not
sure what we will work on yet, but I am thinking we might study some
concurreny problems, etc.
