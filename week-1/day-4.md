# Week 1 Day 4 Notes

Started my day off switching back into work on `cretonne`. I drafted some of
the logic for a small helper class that will be needed, and then got in touch
with the maintainer asking some overview questions to help me along with
the refactoring work.

This afternoon I will be pairing on some Rust work with my friend Sid. Not
sure what we will work on yet, but I am thinking we might study some
concurreny problems, etc.

We spent the bulk of the day working on solutions to the Dining Philosophers
Problem, a traditional hypothetical problem modeling some common issues that
arise in concurrent programming when multiple threads must collectively use
shared resources.

This was a really enjoyable deep dive into the specifics of Rust's threading
model and libraries, and one of the first times that I had really spent more
time trying to solve problems involving concurrency. We both felt like we
came out of the exercises having learned a lot, and this was definitely a
day where I am going home from RC having progressed a lot as a programmer.

Aside from that, we spent the tail end of lunch talking with an alum in the
space about the programming language that they are working, which turned into
a really interesting deep dive into concepts regarding type class systems.
