# Week 1 - Day 0 Notes

My second week (yes I am 0-indexing my blogging notation) started today.
I was first into the space today, which gave me some nice extra time to brew
some coffee, catch up on some Zulip discussions, write up a checkin message
regarding the work I got done on Friday, put together some notes on the next
projects that I will be working on this week, and listen to some techno!

My two main projects are basically in swing now, so I am now working on
adding ELF/Mach-O compatibility to `twiggy`, and helping to refactor some
of `cretonne`'s internal DSL used for describing target ISAs into Rust.

Aside from that, I am also planning to spend some time organizing some
questions/problems for people to work on for the language learning event that
I am putting on this Wednesday :o)

Today I'll largely be dividing my time between the two `twiggy` and `cretonne`
issues however :)
