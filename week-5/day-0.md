It's Monday! Over the weekend I worked semi-sporadically on twiggy, and hit a
really gratifying milestone. I can -finally- print information pulled from a
binary after traversing the tree of debugging information entries! There are
still a variety of other entry tags to add logic for, and I still need to add
size calculation logic for the entries representing variables that I -can-
print right now, but this means I have finished the hardest work to be done!

I spent some time learning more about Haskell over the weekend as well. I am
thinking about working through some Project Euler problems with Haskell, it
seems like a really neat language! I've also been thinking about reading more
about Erlang, so I might devote some time to that soon as well.

The "Hackers" screening over the weekend went well, it was fun introducing so
many people to that movie! Today I'll be working on something for Casey's game
jam, and continuing some twiggy work! I might get some more work done on the
wasm-pack issue I was working on last week, and see how I can take care of
some edge cases that were mentioned.
