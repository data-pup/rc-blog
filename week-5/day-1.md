# Week 6 Day 1 Notes

Yesterday I continued working on twiggy, and can now collect and print the
names of variables, subroutine parameters, and enclosing scopes! I'm going to
try and get size calculation working on one of these fronts today if possible.
That shouldn't be too hard hopefully, since I already have some code that will
find the size of a compilation unit.

Much of the day was spent in the game jam, pairing with Da to make a
lightweight fluid simulation. We made a lot of good progress, and should
probably be able to finish our project sometime this week. Attended
non-technical talks in the evening, and watched some more Star Trek with
everybody.
