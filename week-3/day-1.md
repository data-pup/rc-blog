I spent the morning taking notes on some of Cargo's internals, learning more
about how the build system actually works, and what environment variables are
exposed to crates, and their build scripts.

This helped me orient myself a little more regarding how to augment the
Cretonne build process with some new Rust components. This will be covered
further later, but I spent the rest of the morning in the linear algebra
group.

The linear algebra group was really helpful, and covered an explanation of
the conceptual background of matrix multiplication, and why this operation
does not function component wise.

I spent some time reviewing some of the GitHub issues that I have been working
on, and orienting myself regarding how to spend the rest of my day. I heard
back regarding how my code for `twiggy` is shaping up so far, and everything
looks like it is on the right track.

Another little detail of the early afternoon was finding a way to promote
warnings to errors in Cargo.

At this point, I decided to jump back into some of the cretonne work that I
started this morning.
