I spent the morning taking notes on some of Cargo's internals, learning more
about how the build system actually works, and what environment variables are
exposed to crates, and their build scripts.

This helped me orient myself a little more regarding how to augment the
Cretonne build process with some new Rust components. This will be covered
further later, but I spent the rest of the morning in the linear algebra
group.
