Didn't take many notes today, but made more progress on `cretonne` work, and
confirmed with a maintainer that my approach to reimplementing the Rust DSL is
a good route forward. Realized there are more dependencies in this file than
previously anticipated, but that is fun! More code to write is fun.

Had some nice conversations, and looking forward to a more code oriented day
tomorrow.
