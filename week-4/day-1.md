# Week 4 Day 1 Notes

Spent the morning documenting how I spent my day yesterday, writing up a
description for the WG meeting on Thursday, and putting a pairing event
together using an issue that would be a nice starting point for someone who
has not contributed to an OSS repo before.

Planning on spending today working through the rest of the `wasm-pack` PR
that I opened yesterday, refining some of the control flow hopefully, and
tackling some more of the work on `cretonne` that I have been working on.

Ideally, it would be nice if I can get to the point that a `new-types.rs` file
is emitted in the target directory, but this may depend on how many more
issues I run into regarding the IR types. Whee!

I spent some time working through a PR for `wasm-pack` with a friend, and
helped them make their first contribution to an OSS repo! One of the other
tasks of the day was attending an introduction to Coq. Notes for that are
stored in this folder.
