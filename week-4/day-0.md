# Week 4 Day 0 Notes

I spent some time over the weekend working on my Cretonne and Twiggy projects,
and made some really important progress!

For twiggy, I can now successfully parse through all of the items in an object
file. There are still different variants that I need to account for, but the
issues that I had been dealing with regarding loops and the DIE tree traversal
are now fixed. On the cretonne front, I was also able to get some important
conceptual work done regarding how to refactor some of the inheritance
structure into a network of trait objects and enums.

I also spent some time learning about APL and K, two array based languages,
with my friend. We were able to write a program that finds the largest number
that is a palindrome in some given range. That was a lot of fun, and these
languages were a fun thought exercise that made me consider different
programming paradigms that I previously hadn't spent time looking into.

Today I aim to work on a `wasm-pack` issue, to coordinate versions of a
dependency and only install this package when needed.
