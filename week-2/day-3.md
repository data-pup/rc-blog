# Week 2 Day 3 Notes

## To Do List:

*  CTF Work @ 3:00 - 4:00 w/ Bradley D
*  Rust Study Group - 4:15 - 5:15
*  Result / Option iterators

---

I am going to spend the early part of my day creating some slides on how to
iterate through collections of `Option<T>` and `Result<V, E>`, and some
of the neat methods that are available.

Update: Spent most of the early day and afternoon putting this together, and
I am feeling pretty good about it! Wheee!
