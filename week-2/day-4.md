# Week 2 Day 4 Notes

Didn't take many notes today, but had some nice conversations with friends,
and spent some time cleaning code up. Spent the past day or two feeling like
I am spinning my wheels a little bit, so reviewing some example code and
simplifying some of the code that I had previously written was a nice break
from things.

The talk I gave last night was well received, which felt good, and I planned
some work for next week investigating type systems with one of my friends here.
Watched some Cppconf videos, showing how to do concurrent programming on
different without using mutexes, in a safe way. It was all a little complex,
but really interesting, and I will probably spend some more time reviewing
that soon.

Overall, not bad for a Friday, and I am learning not to be too hard on
myself. That is also an important skill!
